# Mannequinn

A fashion application built using Ruby on Rails. It was made by a small team of three in just 2 weeks as part of the Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp.

Mannequinn is a user to user fashion rental service with sustainability at its heart. We believe that fast fashion has created a demand for “newness” that has no place in a sustainable future and something had to be done to remedy the bad habits of the industry. Our solution? Renting not buying. Getting people to rent instead, means they can still get their kicks from the latest luxury trends and pieces, without burning a hole in their pocket or the planet.

Our community of like-minded, entrepreneurial members are sharing more than just their wardrobes. They’re doing good by looking good.
